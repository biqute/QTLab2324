RS232 Interface

    Unless the conmad starts with "$" charachter, all commands will evoke a response 
    from the instrument. 
    The string is of one or more printing ASCII characters and will be terminater by Carrieage
    Return Character. This may optionally be followed by a Line Feed charachter.
    If the command starts with "$" then the command will oeyed but no responsewill be sent.
    All commands consist of a single letter sometime followed by a numeric parameter,
    the whole is terminated by a Carriage Return.
    If a "?" is answered then some syntax error was made.
    X --> for returning the current instrument status
    Accepted numbers vary from -32768 to 32767. 
    If preceeded by "#" then 0 to 65535.
    Set Temperature to 20 Kelvin

                "T200" or "T20.0"

    Preferable to convert all data to integers
    num = 20
    execute("T"+str(num*10))
    Same for returned commands
