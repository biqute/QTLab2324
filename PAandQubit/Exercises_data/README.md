# 1. Resonator Spectroscopy
    **Resonator resonance frequency:** The resonator resonance frequency is the natural frequency at which a resonator oscillates. This frequency is dependent on the physical characteristics of the resonator and is essential for readout operations. 
Resonators are used to either generate waves of specific frequencies or to select specific frequencies from a signal. 
At this frequency we will be able to observe a clear difference in the transmitted signal: if the resonator is a 3D cavity we will observe an amplified signal, while for a 2D resonator we will observe a higher absorption. In both cases, we expect to see a Lorentzian peak (positive for 3D cavity or negative for 2D resonators).
